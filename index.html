                            A model that I made as a college assignment. We were tasked with modelling a robot that would then eventually be rigged and posed. I went for a more cyborg-looking character with carbon fibre muscles and limbs that float in place using magnets. I fairly went overboard with the "simple robot" requirement, as the assignment was named. This was rendered using Maya's Arnold renderer.

                            My first 3D sculpt model done as a college assignment. This is a bust of my rendition of a Japanese Oni. I gave it a more reflective texture to solidify the feeling of a believable marble sculpture. I may improve and expand on this model in the future and give it an actual body, clothes, and a rig. Rendered in the Arnold renderer.

                            The first environmental setting I've modelled and composited as a college assignment. I went for a "sorcerer's tower" theme as it was a good opportunity to populate the scene with alchemical tools and potions, enchanted books, and strange paintings. I have been thinking about revisiting this assignment and recreating it from the ground up to improve on it.

                            A small game I created as a final assignment for my interactive design class. The character and fx were designed in Illustrator and animated in Adobe Animate. The spritesheet was then taken into html and javascript and coded to be playable by the user. There was a whole backstory for the character, but I didn't have the time to implement it and its game mechanics into the game.

                            A sculpt done in VR using an HTC Vive at my college. I've never tried using a headset before until I made this model, but it turned out to be surprisingly fun. I wanted to take advantage of how size and perspective is perceived within a VR space so I went for a cosmic dragon holding a tiny astronaut in his hand.

                            This is a physical computing exercise that uses input, output, and sensory components. As you move towards the distance sensor, the hand will flex its fingers accordingly. The original plan was for it to be strong enough to pick up a ping pong ball, but the construction of the hand itself didn't allow for that. If I were to reiterate on it, I would 3D print the parts and use elastic bands to mainatin tension in the fingers.

                            A camera-tracking exercise where I tracked a video onto the surface of a skyscraper. I animated it in a way that makes it look like holographic billboard being turned on. This was part of an After Effects tracking exercise, which includes lessons on 3D camera tracking, 2-point tracking, corner pin tracking, and planar tracking.

                    <p>Heya! I'm Rommel Jay Cayanga, but I like to go by RJ. I'm a multimedia designer that has experience in many design fields, such as graphic design, motion design, and interactive design.
                        However, my main objective is to become a skilled 3D designer for the purpose of meeting my ultimate goal: to become a member of a video game pipeline as a 3D environmental artist.
                        <br><br>
                        I have a deep passion for video games, especially the aspect of giving the player a unique experience within a fantastical world. The way the player connects themselves to a world and encounter different challenges and feel such raw emotions is an invigorating experience. I feel that if I could let a player enjoy a video game that I've worked on, that would be an accomplishment in and of itself.</p>
